This repository is being made public to give creators of surf & bhop as much power and flexibility as possible with the modding toolkit, and to provide a place for anybody to contribute to development of Fragsurf in the form of bug reports, bug fixes, improvements, and additions.

Be prepared to encounter bugs and issues, I have not done much testing in cloning the repository or getting new projects set up.  Please report bugs if you come across any so we can create an easy and consistent experience for everybody!

Feel free to clone it, play with it, and create issues and pull requests.  Steam is not required to play Fragsurf, but because it relies on Steam for P2P and other multiplayer features some systems will not work properly without it.
